			This is a simple mini website made for just practice. I made it to complete the task
			given by Mr. Mohit (Our teacher from NIT for the web development course). I had to write
			a paragraph so I am writing whatever comes to my mind. Anyway I have to complete the task
			so this much should be enough.
